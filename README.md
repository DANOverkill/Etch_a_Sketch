This will be an Etch a Sketch project for The Odin Project. 
I've learner how to successfully add muitiple Div elements in a dynamic way. 
I''ve learned how to apply a event listener with a mouse over effect that individually alters the background color to each of the dynamically added divs. This was done with a forEach loop once calling the divs with a document.querySelectorAll.
